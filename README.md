# SimpleEventHTMLjs
An example of how an event schedule formatted for the small screen (ie phones) could be made available for attendees in an event.  

It's a single HTML file with javascript controlling the visibility of certain sections.  Very crude and could be improved upon with CSS styling magic. 

Proof of concept only.
